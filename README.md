A lot of files. You can fined the following code in the following maps:
- The verification code for the in-place selection sort can be found in the map `sorting` under the file `sorting.dfy`. Everything else you see is generated code for which `sorting.cs` is the generated c\# file
- The code for verifying the has map implementation of the key-value store can be found under the map `HashMap` and then the file `hashMap.dfy`. All other files are generated code for which `hashMap.cs` is the generated c\# file. `test.cs` and `test1.cs` are files used to try out the generated code for functionality
- The final folder is me trying things out here and there and it also contains simpler implements of the key-value store verification
